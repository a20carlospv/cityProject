    <h1>History</h1>

    <p>
        After the Roman conquest and the subsequent arrival of the Swabians, the groups that will become the future Sanxenxo are formed, with names such as Gondar, Nantes, Contomil, Baltar or Recarey, and the formation of parishes that in the future will delimit the current municipality.
        History of Sanxenxo, today the Spanish town with the most beaches Puerto de Sanxenxo in ancient times. <br><br>
        From the 9th century the arrival of the Normans begins, ravaging the territory. Only the defense of some nobles, such as Count Don Pedro, manage to contain the Vikings.
        Don Pedro resided in Villar de Ardía with possessions in A Lanzada, as well as ten salt mines in Noalla. <br>
        At the same time, the construction of castles began, such as the fortress, which received the name of Santa María de A Lanzada, and which, together with other towers on the coast, such as Cálogo,
        Cortegada and those of the West in Catoira, would represent as much of notice as a defense against the Normans. <br>
        The Mohammedans also used to come to this coast to get captives and steal their riches, so the Bishop of Compostela, Diego Gelmírez, ordered a small fleet capable of confronting the Mohammedans.
        At the same time, both the fortress and the land of A Lanzada will be involved in the struggles of Queen Doña Urraca, Archbishop Gelmírez, the Osera monastery, etc. Fights that will continue with the fights of the Galician nobility in favor of Pedro I, in the year 1350. <br>
        In the fifteenth century, during the war of the Irmandiños against the power of the nobles, several fortresses were affected, including A Lanzada, owned by the Archbishop of Santiago. After its destruction, the stones were used to build the hermitage on the promontory. <br>
        In later centuries, Sanxenxo would be immersed in the heart of the Jurisdiction of A Lanzada, and its seafaring life would be mediated by the powerful Brotherhood of the Corpo Santo de Pontevedra, which practically controlled fishing from Aguiño to Baiona, passing through Pontevedra. <br>
        Its dependence is full of lawsuits against the dictates of said Brotherhood that, in some way, restricted the rights of the sailors of Sanxenxo and nearby places. <br>
        History of Sanxenxo Already in the 18th century, the Jurisdiction of A Lanzada was made up of: Sanxenxo, a large part of Meaño, Castrelos, Raxó and Samieira, and the O Grove peninsula.
        Interestingly, Portonovo, which is in the middle, was part of the Santo Tomé do Mar de Cambados Reserve. The extension of said Jurisdiction was 120.5 square kilometers.
