    <h2>La dama de Silgar</h2>

    <p>
    <strong><em>"La dama de Silgar"</em></strong> is the best known statue of the tourist town par excellence of Sanxenxo and is located in the sea itself, 
    almost in a corner at the beginning of the promenade.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>"La Madama"</strong> as this work is also known is by the Galician artist Alfonso Vilar Lamelas, 
    born in 1927 and author of most Galician public works and whose figure has become an icon of the town.

    <h2>Church of "San Ginés"</h2>

    <p>
    In the downtown area, very close to the town hall, stands this small church.
    <br>
    The exact date of the temple is not known, but it is true that it was moved to the place it currently occupies from a previous location, 
    around the 17th-18th centuries.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is " marine style " , very common in the area at that time , 
    and has a rectangular floor plan , with a single main nave , 
    from which two side chapels emerge , giving the church the shape of a cross .
    <br>
    From its exterior it is worth noting its slender baroque style tower , 
    as well as the carving of the Virgin located above the entrance door .
    <br>
    Inside, the altar stands out, resting on the urn of the recumbent Christ.
