    <h1>Toponomy</h1>

    <p>
        With regard to the toponym origin of the fishing village of Sanxenxo, it is known that this comes from the accusative of the name of the saint to whom the parish of Padriñán is dedicated: Sanctum Genesium. <br>
         To be more exact, it would correspond to Sanctus Genesius of Arles, a French martyr who died at the beginning of the fourth century. <br>
        In addition, Sanxenxo is a unique toponym in the Galician Gazetteer, since the name of this saint is much more frequent from the genitive form, Genesii,
         which has given rise to the "Xens" forms, in the westernmost area of ​​the territory, and "Xes", in the eastern part. <br>
          Some examples of these Galician derivatives are: San Xes de Vilariño (Lobeira), San Xes (Paderne de Allariz) or San Xes da Peroxa (A Peroxa).
